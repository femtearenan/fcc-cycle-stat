# run-stat - visualizing runner statistics

## Background
This is a React Redux app with enhancements by D3. The purpose of the app is to visualize runner data to find interesting correlations.

The app was first built as a project in [freeCodeCamps Data Visualization Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and has expanded upon that.

## Technologies
This is a JavaScript project using React Redux with D3. Data is fetched from femtearenan.se and its API.

## Data
The data used in this application is created by Anders Bj√∂rkland. The data can not be used in any scientific setting as the precision of some tools used can't be defined.
